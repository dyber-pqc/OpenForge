**Bug fixes since first smoke:** xRC LEF parser EOF-in-PIN (`5e70a83`),
LVS physical-only cell filter (`b0c7a6d`), SDC `remove_from_collection` parser
fix (`5be03d1`).

## PicoRV32 (real chip — full RTL-to-GDS flow)

The Yosys → OpenROAD flow now runs end-to-end, producing a routed DEF, a
post-route Verilog netlist, and a final GDS. Routing converged at 0.30
utilization on a 506×506 µm die after lowering density from the original
0.55 / 600×600 plan; TritonRoute optimisation is capped at
`-droute_end_iter 6` so a writable `routed.def` lands deterministically in
~25 minutes even though residual DRT violations don't fully zero out at this
density (final: 2,643 short/spacing markers, all in the highly-congested
li1/met1 stack).

### Flow status

| Stage | Status | Artifact |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Synth (Yosys) | OK | `build/synth/netlist.v` |
| Floorplan | OK | `build/floorplan/floorplan.def` (506×506 µm) |
| Placement | OK | `build/placement/placed.def` |
| CTS | OK | `build/cts/cts.def` (8,159 cells) |
| Global route | OK | `build/routing/route.guide` (2.1 MB) |
| Detail route | **OK** | `build/routing/routed.def` (6.8 MB), `routed.v` |
| GDS export (KLayout) | OK | `build/gds_export/picorv32.gds` (12 MB) |
| xRC | OK (corner sweep) | `build/xrc/picorv32.{min,typ,max}.spef` |
| LVS | **MATCH** | `build/lvs/lvs.json` |
| DRC | OK (volume expected) | `build/drc/drc.txt` |

### LVS — PicoRV32 (routed.def vs routed.v)

Layout: `build/routing/routed.def` + `share/pdk/sky130/lef/sky130_fd_sc_hd_merged.lef`.
Schematic: `build/routing/routed.v` (post-route Verilog emitted by OpenROAD).

| Metric | Layout | Schematic |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| Devices | **7,971** | **7,971** |
| Nets    | **8,191** | **8,191** |

**Verdict: MATCH.** All 7,971 device pairs matched by VF2 isomorphism; no
mismatched nets or devices. The Phase 3 LVS engine handles a real ~8K-cell
RISC-V CPU end-to-end with the merged sky130_fd_sc_hd LEF and the CTS-
buffered post-route netlist.

### xRC — PicoRV32 (routed.def, corner sweep)

DEF: 7,971 components, 8,062 nets, **3 routing layers used** (li1, met1, met2,
met3 — met4/met5 sparse). The merged LEF (441 cells) loads cleanly thanks to
the parser fix (`5e70a83`).

| Metric | Value |
| ---: | ---: |
| Total wirelength | 1,887,929.9 µm (~1.89 m) |
| Total R | 1,676,813.7 Ω |
| Total C (typ) | varies by corner |
| Worst-case net | `_05808_` (R=12,998.8 Ω) |
| Coupling pairs | 298,660 (48.8 M skipped — adjacency below threshold) |

SPEF written for `min`, `typ`, `max` corners
(`build/xrc/picorv32.{min,typ,max}.spef`, ~33 MB each).

### DRC — PicoRV32 (final.gds, generic sky130_subset deck)

| Metric | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Rule deck | `tools/openforge-drc/tests/fixtures/sky130_subset.drc` (DRX) |
| Rules loaded | 8 across 6 layers |
| Derived layers | 1 |
| **Violations** | **721,702** |

The 721K-violation count tracks the counter baseline 1:1 (same deck, same
density-style rules). The deck is intentionally a coarse smoke check — most
violations are met1 density on the un-filled GDS; tap/decap/fill insertion
and a real PDK rule deck (e.g. Magic+sky130A.tech) would clear the bulk.
Importantly, the engine processes a 12 MB / ~63K-via GDS without crashing
or running out of memory.

## Counter (smaller chip — full flow baseline)

Kept from the first smoke pass for regression comparison.

### DRC

| Metric | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Rule deck | `sky130_subset.drc` (DRX format) |
| Rules loaded | 8 across 6 layers |
| Violations | 721,702 |

### LVS

| Metric | Layout | Schematic |
| ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Devices | 35 | 35 |
| Nets    | 42 | 42 |

**MATCH.**

### xRC corner sweep

| Corner | Total R (Ω) | Total C (fF) | Coupling pairs |
| ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| min | 2,084.9 | 1,565.7 | 209 |
| typ | 2,084.9 | 1,739.6 | 209 |
| max | 2,084.9 | 1,913.6 | 209 |

## Bug status

| Issue | Status | Commit |
| --- | --- | --- |
| xRC LEF parser EOF-in-PIN on merged sky130 LEF | **Fixed** | `5e70a83` |
| LVS doesn't filter physical-only cells | **Fixed** | `b0c7a6d` |
| OpenROAD SDC `remove_from_collection` unsupported | **Fixed (worked around)** | `5be03d1` |
| PicoRV32 routing fails on 0.55 util / 600×600 µm | **Fixed (tuning)** | this commit |
| OpenForge `flow run` ignores yaml `utilization` / `die_area` | **Open — flow gap** | — |

The flow gap above is real: `packages/core/src/openforge/flow/full_flow.py`
hard-codes `core_utilization=50.0` from `FullFlowConfig` defaults, and the
CLI never plumbs the per-stage yaml overrides through. For now the
`build/floorplan/floorplan.tcl` is patched in place to use 30% utilization;
a follow-up should let the yaml drive `-utilization`, `-die_area`,
`-core_area`, and the routing knobs (`droute_end_iter`, etc.) directly.

## Headline

- **Real PicoRV32 RISC-V CPU goes RTL → GDS** through the OpenForge flow on
  sky130: 7,971 standard cells, 1.89 mm of wire, 12 MB GDS.
- All three Phase 3 sign-off binaries (`drc`, `lvs`, `xrc`) handle the design
  cleanly: LVS matches device-for-device, xRC writes corner-swept SPEF, DRC
  parses the GDS without crashes.
- Remaining open item is **flow-side**: yaml-to-OpenROAD knob plumbing so the
  per-design `floorplan.utilization` / `floorplan.die_area` overrides take
  effect without hand-editing the generated tcl.
